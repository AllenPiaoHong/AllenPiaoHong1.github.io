## About Me

My name is Wang PiaoHong (çŽ‹é£˜é¸¿ in Chinese). I am a first year Ph.D. student at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I am lucky to study under the guidance of Prof. [ZhiCong Lu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/).
I am currently interested in social computing and funny visual HCI system development (e.g., Live streaming, VR, Short video).        

## Research Interests

- **Live Streaming:**  Funny live streaming system development or live streaming + **X** study.
- **Short video:** Interesting short video + **X** study.  
- **VR and Immersive Technology:** I am a big fan of [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)). 

## Research Methods

- **Data Driven Study** : Analyze funny data collected from social media (from Feb 2023).
- **System Development** : To be honest, I am a novice in this area (from May 2023).
- **User Study** : Interview, coding and long-term headache from paper writing (from Sep 2022).
